                                    <p>The JavaScript within a chrome browser is implemented by V8 engine.
                                        <br/>
                                        The V8 engine has two parts:<br/>
                                        Memory Heap<br/>
                                        Call Stack
                                        <br/>
                                        Memory Heap: It is used to allocate the memory used by your JavaScript program. Remember memory heap is not the same as the heap data structures, they are totally different. It is the free space inside your OS.
                                        <br/>    
                                        Call Stack: Within the call stack, your JS code is read and gets executed line by line.
                                    
                                        <img src="/javascriptNotes/assets/img/jsEngine.png"/>
                                    </p>

                                        JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language, which means it has a single Call Stack. Therefore it can do one thing at a time.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The Call Stack is a data structure which records basically where in the program we are. If we step into a function, we put it on the top of the stack. If we return from a function, we pop off the top of the stack. That’s all the stack can do.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        JavaScript is a single-threaded language because while running code on a single thread, it can be really easy to implement as we don’t have to deal with the complicated scenarios that arise in the multi-threaded environment like deadlock.

                                Within JS we have a lexical environment, syntax parser, an execution context (memory heap and call stack) that is used to execute the JS code. But except these browsers also have Event Loops, Callback queue, and WebAPIs that is also used to run the JS code. Although these are not part of JS it also helps to execute the JS properly as we sometimes used the browser functions within the JS.
                                <p>
                                    As you can see in the previoud diagram, DOM, AJAX, and Timeout are not actually part of JavaScript but the part of RunTime Environment or browser, so these can be run asynchronously within the WebAPI using the callback queue and again put in the call stack using event loop to execute.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Let us take an example to be very clear of the concept. Suppose we have the following piece of code that we want to execute in the JS run-time environment.
                                </p>
                                <div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
                                    <pre class="highlight javascript">
                                        <code>
                                            console.log('A');
   
                                            setTimeout(() => {
                                               console.log('B');
                                              }, 3000);
                                                
                                            console.log('C');

                                            // OUTPUT
                                            // A C B
                                        </code>
                                    </pre>
                                </div>
                                <p>
                                    When JS tries to execute the above program, it places the first statement in the call stack which gets executed and prints A in the console and it gets to pop out of the stack. Now, it places the second statement in the call stack and when it tries to execute the statement, it finds out that setTimeout() doesn’t belong to JS so it pops out the function and puts in the WebAPI to get executed there. Since the call stack is now again empty, it places the third statement in the stack and executes it thus prints C in the console.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In the meanwhile, the WebAPI executes the timeout function and places the code in the callback queue. The eventloop checks if the call stack is empty or not or whether there is any statement in the callback queue that needs to be executed all the time. As soon as the event loop checks that the call stack is empty and there is something in the callback queue that needs to be executed, it places the statement in the call stack and the call stack executes the statement and prints B in the console of the browser.

                                The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it.<br/>

                              <p class="card-text">
                                It’s important to note that setTimeout(…) doesn’t automatically put your callback on the event loop queue. It sets up a timer. When the timer expires, the environment places your callback into the event loop, so that some future tick will pick it up and execute it. Take a look at this code:
                                <code>setTimeout(myCallback, 1000);</code>
                                <p>That doesn’t mean that myCallback will be executed in 1,000 ms but rather that, in 1,000 ms, myCallback will be added to the event loop queue. The queue, however, might have other events that have been added earlier — your callback will have to wait.</p>
